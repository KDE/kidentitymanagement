     I have implemented SSL support.  This is done with a really fudged
     set of automake rules due to the fact that I don't know how to
     properly use automake/autoconf yet.  (This is my first time!!)  The
     spop3.cc file is generated in order to keep a common codebase between
     the pop3/spop3 ioslaves.  #define SPOP3 to get the SSL version.  This
     was developed using OpenSSL 0.9.5 and tested against a mail server
     wrapped with sslwrap 2.05.  Hopefully someone can clean this up for me.

     I copied the configure.in.in from the http ioslave.  It seem to do the
     job just fine, and to my surprise, they use the same hack that I do.
