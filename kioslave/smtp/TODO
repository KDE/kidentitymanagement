1. Implement LF->CRLF and dotstuffing in the slave. It's a kind of
   transfer encoding and the app using the slave should not be
   bothered to handle it.
2. Implement the CHUNKING extension (rfc 3030; as soon as I find an
   SMTP server that supports it) (should have (1))
3. Better error message (translated standard meanings of the known
   response codes, ENHANCEDSTATUSCODES extension (rfc2034))
4. (KIO) MultiPutJob to support pipelining across messages
5. Ged rid of slave's header generation after checking who on earth
   uses that...

and further refactoring to make the code pleasant to look at ;-)
