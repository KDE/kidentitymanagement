This is a collection of changes which should eventually be done:

- Emit resourceClosed(Resource*) signal in Resource::close(). For othogonality
we should probably also emit resourceOpened(), resourceLoaded(), resourceSaved()
signals.
- Add function to Resource to return the translated label of the type
- Find better solution than passing the family name as string to the Manager
  constructor.
- Improve read-only handling (notify configuration widgets of read-only flag
  changes, etc.)
- Add ability to have subresources, so a single resource can have
  multiple subdirs. The more general solution would be a complete
  storage tree in each resource.
- Framework widgets - like the resource chooser in KOrganizer and a
  resource chooser for writing an entry for the first time
- Improve usability - for example there should be only one of some of the
  items
