   * @short Abstraction of a signature (aka "footer").
   *
   * The signature can either be plain text, HTML text, text returned from a command or text stored
   * in a file.
   *
   * In case of HTML text, the signature can contain images.
   * Since you set the HTML source with setText(), there also needs to be a way to add the images
   * to the signature, as the HTML source contains only the img tags that reference those images.
   * To add the image to the signature, call addImage(). The name given there must match the name
   * of the img tag in the HTML source.
   *
   * The images need to be stored somewhere. The Signature class handles that by storing all images
   * in a directory. You must set that directory with setImageLocation(), before calling addImage().
   * The images added with addImage() are then saved to that directory when calling writeConfig().
   * When loading a signature, readConfig() automatically loads the images as well.
   * To actually add the images to a text edit, call insertIntoTextEdit().
